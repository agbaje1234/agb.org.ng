	What is JavaScript?</br>
JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages
in the Netscape Navigator browser. The language has since been adopted
by all other major graphical web browsers. It has made modern web 6 
applications possible—applications with which you can interact directly,
without doing a page reload for every action. But it is also used in
more traditional websites to provide various forms of interactivity and
cleverness.
It is important to note that JavaScript has almost nothing to do
with the programming language named Java. The similar name was inspired
by marketing considerations, rather than good judgment. When
JavaScript was being introduced, the Java language was being heavily
marketed and was gaining popularity. Someone thought it was a good
idea to try to ride along on this success. Now we are stuck with the
name.
After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standard document was written
to describe the way the JavaScript language should work to make
sure the various pieces of software that claimed to support JavaScript
were actually talking about the same language. This is called the ECMAScript
standard, after the Ecma International organization that did
the standardization. In practice, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript
can be used interchangeably—they are two names for the same language.

Programming with JavaScript</br>
Programming is all about speaking the language of computers. If you’re a robot, this should be pretty easy for you, but if you’re unlucky enough to be a human, it might take a bit of adjustment.
If you want to learn how to program, there are really two things you have to get your head around. First, you have to think about reducing one big problem into small, digestible chunks that are just right for a computer to crunch. Second, you have to know how to translate those chunks into a language that the computer understands.
I find that the second part—the syntax—gradually becomes second nature (much like when you learn a real second language), and experienced programmers have very little trouble switching between different languages (like JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, or Algol 60). Most of the thought in programming is focused on the first part—thinking about how you can break down a problem so that the computer can solve it.
By the time you’ve finished this book, you’ll understand most of the syntax that JavaScript has to offer, but you’ll continue learning new ways to solve programming
Simply JavaScript 14 problems for as long as you continue to program. We’ll tell you how to solve quite a few problems in this book, but there are always different ways to achieve a given task, and there will always be new problems to solve, so don’t think that your learning will stop on the last page of this book.
